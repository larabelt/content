## How to Create an Itinerary

Before starting your Itinerary, add the places you want to include in your Itinerary, under "Places." For instructions on how to add a place, see page X.

To create the Itinerary "Advanced Diving Trips," start by going to Content â†’ Lists and click on the "Add a List" button

#### Main tab:

* In the list creator, under the Main tab, change "Type" to "Itinerary"

@include('belt-docs::partials.image', [
    'src' => '20/admin/content/assets/list-creator-itinerary-subtype.png',
    'caption' => '',
])

* Check "Is active"
* Assign your Itinerary a name, "Diving Trips" At this point, save.

@include('belt-docs::partials.image', [
    'src' => '20/admin/content/assets/list-creator-itinerary-name.png',
    'caption' => '',
])

At this point you will have access to other fields and tabs. The slug will automatically populate from your Itinerary Name

@include('belt-docs::partials.image', [

    'caption' => '',
])
