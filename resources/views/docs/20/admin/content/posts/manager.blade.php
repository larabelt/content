## Managing Posts

The main dashboard allows for quick management of already existing posts. You can create a post by selecting "Add Post." "Modify" and "Delete" buttons sit to the right of the post within the action column.

@include('belt-docs::partials.iframe', ['src' => '/docs/preview/content/2.0/admin/screen?content=manager.posts&style=content'])
